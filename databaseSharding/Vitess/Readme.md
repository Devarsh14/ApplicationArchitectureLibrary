Vitess : built in shading for db.
I wish, MsSql would have supported this in-built like this.  Hope so this toll delivers what it says on the book cover

"Vitess is compatible with MySQL while extending its scalability. Its built-in sharding lets you grow your database without adding sharding logic to your application."

"MySQL doesn't natively support sharding, but you will likely need it as your database grows. Vitess provides flexible sharding schemes that are completely transparent to the application. It also enables live resharding with minimal read-only downtime."
Vitess | Scalable. Reliable. MySQL-compatible. Cloud-native. Database.
