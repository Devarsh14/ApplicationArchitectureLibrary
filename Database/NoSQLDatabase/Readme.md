# Types of NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases are categorized based on their data model. Here are the main types:

1. **Document Databases**
    - Store data in JSON, BSON, or XML documents.
    - Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB

2. **Key-Value Stores**
    - Store data as key-value pairs.
    - Examples: Redis, DynamoDB

3. **Column-Family Stores**
    - Store data in columns and rows, similar to relational databases but optimized for large-scale queries.
    - Examples: Cassandra, HBase

4. **Graph Databases**
    - Store data in nodes, edges, and properties to represent and traverse relationships.
    - Examples: Neo4j, ArangoDB

Each type of NoSQL database is designed to handle specific data storage and retrieval needs, offering flexibility and scalability for different use cases.
