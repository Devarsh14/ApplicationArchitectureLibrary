When discussing software applications or system applications, several important terms and concepts are frequently used to describe their design, development, and architecture. These terms help provide a common language for developers, architects, and other stakeholders involved in creating software systems. Here’s a list of key terms:

### 1. **Functional Requirements**
   - Descriptions of the specific behaviors, features, or functions a system must perform. Examples include user authentication, data entry, reporting, etc.

### 2. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
   - Requirements that define system properties, such as:
     - **Scalability**: The ability of the system to handle growth, such as increased users or data.
     - **Performance**: How fast the system performs under specific conditions.
     - **Reliability**: The ability of the system to perform consistently and handle failures.
     - **Availability**: The percentage of time the system is operational.
     - **Security**: Protecting data and ensuring only authorized users can perform certain actions.
     - **Usability**: How easy the system is for users to understand and use.
     - **Maintainability**: How easy it is to make updates or fixes.

### 3. **Architecture**
   - **Monolithic Architecture**: A design where the entire system is built as a single unit, with all components tightly coupled.
   - **Microservices Architecture**: A design where the system is broken into loosely-coupled, independent services that can be deployed and scaled independently.
   - **Serverless Architecture**: A cloud-computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure, and the developer only needs to write the code.
   - **Layered Architecture**: The system is divided into layers (e.g., presentation, business, data), which provide separation of concerns.

### 4. **Design Patterns**
   - **Singleton**: Ensures that only one instance of a class exists.
   - **Observer**: Allows objects to subscribe to and receive updates from other objects.
   - **Factory**: A method to create objects without specifying the exact class.
   - **Repository**: Provides an abstraction over data access, making the data handling more manageable and testable.

### 5. **Scalability Types**
   - **Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up)**: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing server.
   - **Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out)**: Adding more servers to distribute load.

### 6. **Load Balancer**
   - A device or software that distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed.

### 7. **API (Application Programming Interface)**
   - **REST API**: An architectural style that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) to interact with resources.
   - **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that provides more flexibility in data retrieval.
   - **gRPC**: A high-performance, open-source, remote procedure call (RPC) framework.

### 8. **Middleware**
   - Software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications, especially in distributed computing.

### 9. **Client-Server Model**
   - **Client**: The part of the system that interacts with users (e.g., browser, mobile app).
   - **Server**: The part that processes requests and provides data or functionality to clients.

### 10. **Database Terms**
   - **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: A language used to manage and query relational databases.
   - **NoSQL**: Databases designed to store and retrieve large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.
   - **Normalization**: The process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy.
   - **Sharding**: A database scaling method where data is split across multiple databases or servers.

### 11. **Caching**
   - Storing data temporarily to reduce load on the database or improve performance. Technologies like Redis or Memcached are common for caching.

### 12. **Concurrency**
   - The ability of the system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Important in systems with high user activity.

### 13. **Load Testing / Stress Testing**
   - Methods to determine how a system performs under load or extreme conditions, ensuring stability and performance under various scenarios.

### 14. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
   - A software design style where services are provided to the other components over a network. Each service is independent, reusable, and interoperable.

### 15. **Deployment Models**
   - **On-Premises**: The system is hosted in the organization’s own infrastructure.
   - **Cloud Deployment**: The system is hosted by cloud service providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
   - **Hybrid Deployment**: A combination of on-premises and cloud-based deployment.

### 16. **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**
   - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Regularly merging all developers' code changes to a central repository.
   - **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automating the deployment of code changes to production.

### 17. **Containerization**
   - Packaging software and dependencies into containers (e.g., using Docker), which allows consistency across environments and simplifies deployment.

### 18. **Orchestration**
   - Managing the lifecycle of containers, often using **Kubernetes** to ensure applications run reliably at scale.

### 19. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or system.
   - **Authorization**: Granting or denying permissions to authenticated users.

### 20. **Fault Tolerance**
   - The system’s ability to continue operating properly in the event of a failure of one or more components.

### 21. **DevOps**
   - A set of practices aimed at unifying software development and operations, emphasizing automation, collaboration, and rapid delivery.

### 22. **Version Control**
   - Systems like **Git** used to track changes in codebases, manage branches, and collaborate among developers.

### 23. **Testing Types**
   - **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation.
   - **Integration Testing**: Testing how different components work together.
   - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Testing the entire system from start to finish.

### 24. **Message Queue**
   - Tools like **RabbitMQ** or **Apache Kafka** used for asynchronous communication between components, improving decoupling and scalability.

### 25. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
   - An approach to software design that focuses on modeling the business domain and its rules, often using terms that closely represent the business itself.

### 26. **Reverse Proxy**
   - A server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client requests to them. Examples include **Nginx** or **HAProxy**.

### 27. **API Gateway**
   - A server that acts as an entry point for clients to access microservices, providing features like authentication, load balancing, and request routing.

### 28. **Multitenancy**
   - A software architecture where a single instance serves multiple tenants, each with its isolated data.

### 29. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**
   - An approach where events are used to trigger and communicate between decoupled services. It’s commonly used for asynchronous systems.

### 30. **CAP Theorem**
   - States that a distributed system cannot simultaneously guarantee **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance**. At most, only two of these properties can be fully satisfied.

### 31. **GraphQL vs REST**
   - **GraphQL**: A more flexible API query language that allows clients to request exactly what they need.
   - **REST**: A stateless architecture that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### 32. **Edge Computing**
   - Bringing computation and data storage closer to the data source to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.

### 33. **Scaling Strategies**
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to handle increased load.
   - **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing the capacity of existing machines (e.g., more CPU/RAM).

### 34. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - **Logging**: Collecting system activity (e.g., **ELK Stack**, **Serilog**).
   - **Monitoring**: Observing system performance and health (e.g., **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **New Relic**).

### 35. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame to protect the system from abuse.

These terms provide a foundational vocabulary for discussing software systems, whether you're working on system design, architecture, or implementation. Each concept plays a crucial role in understanding, building, and maintaining scalable, maintainable, and high-quality software applications.
